== CODE:

http://pingfm.rubyforge.org/

== DESCRIPTION:

Ping.fm (http://ping.fm) is a simple service that makes updating your social networks a snap, and this it's Ruby library.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Installing the gem creates a 'pingfm' shell script to post from the shell.
* Keys are stored in a YAML file in your home directory (under Linux/OSX).

== SYNOPSIS:

Shell usage:

  $ pingfm This message will post to my default services.

Everything after the 'pingfm' command is what will be posted to the service.  You
may also include the message within quotes (ex. using the client within a shell script).

If your keys have not been stored, it will ask for them.  These keys will be saved
in a YAML file in your home directory and you won't be asked for them again.

You can obtain your keys here:

* User API Key - http://ping.fm/key/
* Application API Key - http://ping.fm/developers/

Library usage:

  # Require the library and initialize it.
  require 'pingfm'
  pingfm = Pingfm::Client.new('api_key', 'user_app_key')

  # Ensure proper API and User App keys.
  pingfm.validate['status']
  # => 'OK' if success, otherwise 'FAIL'

  # Grab latest 5 posts.
  pingfm.latest(5)  # => {'messages' => [...]}

  # Posting to all services.
  pingfm.post('The Dark Knight was amazing.')
  # => {'status' => 'OK'} if success, otherwise 'FAIL'

  # Post using custom user trigger; must be defined on the Ping.fm site.
  pingfm.tpost('The message here.', '#something_custom', 'Optional Title')
  # => {'status' => 'OK'} if success, otherwise 'FAIL'
